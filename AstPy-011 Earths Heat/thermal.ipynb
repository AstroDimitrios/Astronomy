    "1) Try changing $b$ what does it do? \n",
    "\n",
    "$b$ is the characteristic depth of radioactive elements in the crust which produce heat as they decay (this is in fact the primary heat source for the Earth, the other being heat left over from when the Earth formed). Radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium are lithophile elements which tend to move out of a partially molten mantle into the crust within igneous rocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how increasing the depth at which we find these radioactive elements increases the temperature of the lithosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) By changing some of the model parameters get a temperature of $700^{\\circ}C$ at $35\\ km$. Is there one way of doing it? Which parameters do you think we know best?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most crustal rocks will start melting at $700^{\\circ}C$. The geothermal gradient is not uniform over the Earth at the same depth. The geotherm at the boundary of tectonic plates and the geotherm in the middle of a continent away from hot spots are going to be very different. A region of higher tectonic activity will have a quicker increase in temperature with depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have been able to get $700^{\\circ}C$ a variety of ways. Increasing the mantle heat flow $Q$ for instance as if this point was at a region of tectonic activity or a hot spot. It is far easier to get accurate values for surface temperature and the thermal conductivity of the rock than it is the mantle heat flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) These equations assume that the heat flow is by conduction only? Is that a valid assumption and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! The lithosphere is rigid so heat flow is primarily via conduction. However in regions of higher tectonic activity or where island arcs are forming heat flow from advection needs to be considered. Advection is heat transfer from a moving body of fluid in this case magma. This magma can rise into the lithosphere and cool to become an intrusive igneous formation called a pluton. When it cools it transfers thermal energy to the surounding lithosphere.\n",
