# Team Seas - River Pollution

## team_seas.ipynb
## AIM - To analyse plastic discharge by rivers using data from the Ocean Cleanup Project
Difficulty: Easy

## Intro

<p>This activity is inspired by the work of the <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">Ocean Cleanup Project</a> and #TeamSeas started by YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY">MrBeast</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDx6DjNLDU">Mark Rober</a>. It uses data from Meijer L. J. J. et al., 2021, <em>Sci. Adv.</em>, More than 1000 rivers account for 80% of global riverine plastic emissions into the ocean, DOI: <a href="10.1126/sciadv.aaz5803">10.1126/sciadv.aaz5803</a> which is provided <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supplementary_data_for_More_than_1000_rivers_account_for_80_of_global_riverine_plsatic_emissions_into_the_ocean_/14515590">here</a> and has been downloaded into the **Meijer2021_midpoint_emissions** directory for this activity.</p>
<p>Explore the Ocean Cleanup Projects' interactive map version of this data on their website <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/sources/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the full #TeamSeas campaign to remove plastic from the Ocean <a href="https://teamseas.org/">here</a> (I am in no way affiliated with any campaigns or organisations listed above).</p>

Students create maps of their local area showing river pollution and analyse rivers by country. Some example figures are shown below and stored in the **Figures** directory.
