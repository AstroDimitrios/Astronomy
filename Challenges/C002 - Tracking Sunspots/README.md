# Summer 2020 Challenge - Tracking Sunspots

Create a program to track sunspots across the face of the Sun automatically.
You may use any python modules. I suggest using SunPy for retrieving images of the Sun.
How can you use your tracking code to calculate the rotation period of the sun?

My attempt at this is in the AstPy-6 activity (no peeking!).
