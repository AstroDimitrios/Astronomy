# June 2020 Challenge - Closest Approach

Calculate the time between when a planet is at its closest to the Earth and when a planet is at its furthest from the Earth.

This gif shows the distance between the Earth and Mars over one orbit of Mars assuming they start at their closest approach. The maximum separation between the Earth and Mars is shown as 2.649 AU. How long will it take for the two planets to reach that maximum separation of 2.649 AU? You may use astropy's units module but no other astronomy related python package.

## My solution

My solution is contained in **closestApproach.py** and explained in **closestApproach.ipynb**.
The normal py file takes the result and also animates it to create this:
