## AIM - Visualise the atmospheric composition of planets

**Predict**

Have a think about these questions and make some predictions! Be sure to tell someone else what you predict.

1) How do we know what the atmospheres of other planets contain?    
2) Do all the rocky planets have similar atmospheres?     
3) Do all planets have atmospheres?  

## Intro

Creating figures of the composition of planetary atmospheres.  
Comparing the compositions of planetary atmospheres.  
Calculating whether certain gases are retained by the planet or whether they escape into space.

**atmospheres.py** makes all the stacked bar chart compositional plots for the planets.  
**chemical_dist.py** makes the plots of the abundance of one gas in the atmospheres of all planets.  
**exobase.py** makes the plot of escape velocity vs temperature.      
All these **.py** files are in the ***figures*** directory.

## Challenges

1) Tidy up your plots to make them more readable.  
2) Find data for the Galilean moons and perhaps also Titan (Saturn's moon). What are their atmospheres made of?  
3) Calculate the lightest gas particle which can remain in Mercurys atmosphere.

# Data Files

## atmospheres.csv

Data from Rauf KM et al. (2015) Comparing the Atmospheric Compositions of All Planets and Giant Moons in Solar System [https://www.longdom.org/open-access/comparing-the-atmospheric-compositions-of-all-planets-and-giant-moons-in-solar-system-2332-2519-1000136.pdf](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/comparing-the-atmospheric-compositions-of-all-planets-and-giant-moons-in-solar-system-2332-2519-1000136.pdf) 

Contains percentage compositions for different gases in the atmospheres of the planets + Pluto.

## exobase.csv
found in the ***figures*** directory

From A. Garcia Munoz et al - Upper Atmospheres and Ionospheres of Planets and Satellites [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf)

Contains data on the exobase (bottom layer of the exosphere) for the planets and Titan.

***object*** - name of the object  
***exobase alt*** - altitude in the atmosphere of the exobase (km)  
***exobase alt range*** - if the value in the paper was given as a range ***exobase alt*** is the center value and this column contains the range either side of possible values (similar to a +- error but I hesitate to call it that) in km  
***exobase temp high*** - max temp of the exobase in K (daytime)  
***exobase temp low*** - min temp of the exobase in K (nightime) - sometimes this is the same as the high value  
***esc vel*** - the escape velocity of the planet in km/s  

Note the temperatures for Mercury are average surface temperatures since it has no appreciable atmosphere.

For information on the **planets.csv** which is present here see the ***Data*** or ***AstPy-8 Planets*** directories.
